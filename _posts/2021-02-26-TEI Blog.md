# **Transcribing using TEI**

After reading The Yellow Wallpaper' by Charlotte Perkins Stetson we were each assigned a portion of the manuscript version using Oxygen.TEI (a set of standardized XML tags) to markup the text. We had to analyze weird spacing, misspelled words, and other interesting writing faults throughout the text. 

**Markup in Google Doc**

Before we even touched Oxygen XML Editor, we used google docs to make up parts of the story. To do this we used the comment feature on google docs. Looking through the manuscript it was interesting to see how Stetson chose to break up her paragraphs. She wrote in short sections with odd spacing and awkward edits. I enjoyed viewing the story in her own handwriting. After reading the published version that people are more familiar with, this manuscript came across as a lot more personal. Thankfully I had access to the typed version of her manuscript which made it easier to read.

I later learned that she wrote The Yellow Wallpaper in only two days! This could explain all of the markups she made in it. I know personally when I write a first draft I change a lot of things and then continue with subsequent drafts to make small changes. 

**Oxygen**

Previously I took a web publishing class where we used HTML and CSS. It is the same concept as Oxygen XML Editor, where the objective is to code, but it is trickier to use. When using Oxygen there were templates that can be applied to the kind of project. In this case we were using Manuscript Description which made things easier for me. Using the different tags it felt like I was learning a new language. For every beginning tag there must be an ending tag. It looks something like this.

I was lucky enough to have a relatively easy section of the manuscript to code than did some of my classmates. All I needed to do was complete strike throughs of words, awkward spaces, underlined words, and word changes. Once I figured out the correct code it was easy to spot what I needed to for each markup I made in my google document. To make sure I was on the right track I would flip to the author tab to see what my code looked like when it was finalized. It was really fun seeing my work. If I forgot a tag or didn’t format it correctly the system would notify me with a red square on the upper right side of the page signifying something was wrong.

Overall, I learned a lot from this project. I usually analyze text in my english classes, but it was fun actually creating an online manuscript for The Yellow Wallpaper. I was always a little out of my comfort zone with coding, but I’m happy that I was able to take another try at. I would definitely recommend using Oxygen XML Editor.
