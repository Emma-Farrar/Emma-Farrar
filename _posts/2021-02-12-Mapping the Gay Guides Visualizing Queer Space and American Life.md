**About**

*Mapping the Gay Guides: Visualizing Queer Space and American Life (MGG)* is a web guide developed by Dr.’s Amanda Regan and Eric Gonzaba, in 2020, to help gay and queer travelers find locations to visit or take vacations where they would feel welcome and meet other gay people. It’s based on personal notebooks created in the 60’s and 70’s, by Bob Damron, who documented his travels as a gay man. MGG sought to bring Damron’s guides to the internet so they could be used by the wider gay population. The MGG associates geographical coordinates with each location mentioned by Damron. Thus the MGG provides an interactive visualization to its users.



**Site Navigation**

The homepage has a very helpful introduction to the website with a section specifically focused on navigating the site. The headers include About, Map, Vignettes, Methodology, Ethics, and News. There are also links to their Twitter and Github sites. It’s a smart idea to have other information platforms linked to the site, especially those easily accessible on a phone.  



**Tabs**

In the Vignette tab you can choose from short essays about different places with reviews for each of them. They include images and some have attached videos that break up the text and make it more interesting.

The Methodology tab is all about how the dataset was created. This explains how the map was created and why certain fields were picked. I like the included graph which adds another visualization to further explain the research.

The Ethics tab is a short explanation of the meaning and methodology behind the project. It demonstrates the directors’ credibility on the subject and their passion about it. This was a nice section to include so that visitors have a better understanding about the importance of this project and how useful it could be in the gay community. 

The News tab has a number of articles about the project to help get people interested in the idea of a gay travel guide. It might be useful to have a short introduction so that when you clicked that tab you knew exactly what you were looking at.

**The Map**

This subheading on the website allows you to look at the location of each entry in Bob Damron's Address Book, along with information about how the locations were classified by the Damron Corporation. The dropdown menus above and the slider to the right can be used to filter the data by state, featured amenity, location type, or year. Then they pop up on the map so that the user can zoom in to find the exact location. 

Underneath the map is a table that has all of the locations labeled. I thought this was more user friendly than just the map. I think the idea and aesthetic of the map is a good idea, but I feel like you have to zoom in a lot to be able to find a specific location. Being able to click on the point and zoom in is useful but including a visualization of the actual place you want to visit might be a nice addition.

Overall though, I really like the map feature. Collecting the data from Bob Damron's Address Book and transforming it into an interactive map makes it accessible online.

**Digital Humanities**

This website does a good job blending text with visuals, as well as interactive attributes. The map is useful to locate places that existed at the time. By using different headers, a visitor can click through them to learn more about how and why the directors made this project.

I think the subject matter itself is a good humanities project. It deals with society and culture which is especially important when traveling. Being a minority in a society, it was important to have some type of guide specifically for gays. It sent the message that you were important and communities would welcome you with open arms.

**iPhone**

One critique I have concerns using the website on my phone; it caused everything to feel squished together. The words went right to the edge of the page and the map didn’t fit. I had to do a lot of zooming out to see everything. However, I think this is a great website to view on a larger platform with a big screen.

Overall, I think that this project was well put together especially in terms of a friendly user mindset. Combining datasets with interactive features makes the whole experience more enjoyable and realistically functional.
