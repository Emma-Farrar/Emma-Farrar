**Grant Relection**

Right now, a partner and I are in the process of writing a grant  for the first time. We are creating a digital project designed to help people educate themselves about the horrors of kidnapping in the United States. In order to show the progression of the problem over time, we decided to exhibit America’s kidnapping hotspots and recurring trends during the early 2000s, mid-2010s, and 2020, through the use of an interactive map. As a woman I can remember from a young age my parents warning me about the possibility of being kidnapped. They taught me how to protect myself and things I could do to avoid being in dangerous situations. I was very fortunate that my parents took this issue seriously and it is important that everyone be educated on this topic. The more people know about it the more they can protect themselves and help educate others.

After writing our abstract and receiving feedback we still have the same goal for our grant. However, we needed to scale back what we could actually accomplish with the budget we were given. But after doing more research we were able to find a website design that would help our ideas come to life, and remain within our budget. We also thought more about the specific time periods we want to illustrate. Using data from too many consecutive years could make our map unintelligible, so we focused on the early 2000s, mid-2010s, and 2020. Using ten-year periods will really show the difference in the data.

Searching for other projects similar to ours the closest one we found was The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative. This is the first global data hub on human trafficking, with data contributed by organizations from around the world. While that website focuses primarily on data we want to add more interactive and educational features. Having depictive maps is only part of providing our data. Including additional information that is interesting to younger people is key to getting them engaged on this topic. We want all age groups to be able to come to our website and understand our message. 

This is my first time writing a grant so this was an interesting experience. Because this writing style is slightly different than what I’m used to, having to think through all the  details has been a challenge. I realized that I have to describe my idea thoroughly so other people understand fully what I’m trying to achieve. It seems to me that it’s very much a pitch for an idea, as well as an application.

**Class Reflection**

Coming into this class I didn’t really know what to expect. Doing the grant writing assignment really immersed me in Digital Humanities. During the semester I came to see that the course is a very modern take on what humanities has been. I’ve come to understand that as we evolve in society we have to be aware of the changes and be able to interpret them more fully. 

In regards to the readings I thought they were relevant to what we were doing in class. I appreciated that they were short and to the point. The ones that explained what a grant is plus tips for creating one were most useful. These articles were helpful in deciding what kind of project I wanted to do. 
Out of all the assignments, I really enjoyed blogging. It was fun trying out a different style of writing. Being able to review a website in a professional manner while also writing my own opinion on it gave me a different perspective. I also found that tweeting is a more engaging way to talk about the readings or what we were doing during the week. I don’t use Twitter very often but this was a lot more effective than using the discussion board. It was nice being able to respond to people and then immediately get their response to the readings.

Since digital humanities relates to technology using Twitter was a clever idea!  Because you’re only allowed 40 characters, you really have to think carefully about what you want to say. This was more interesting than just writing on the discussion board. Most people use Twitter so this forum was great to be able to get engagement from others.

Even though I’m a senior and have taken other writing courses, I’m still learning how to be a stronger writer. I never really thought about the order of things and what might make sense to people when reading my work. Of course this depends on the audience, but I’m also learning about the perfect balance of informal and formal writing. Everything I’ve learned in this class has real life applications especially in the work field I would like to pursue.
