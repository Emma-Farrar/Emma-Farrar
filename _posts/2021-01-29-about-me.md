# Emma Farrar's About Me

Hailing from Alexandria Virginia, I’m an only child and when not at Christopher Newport University, live with my parents, and our seven year old welsh terrier, Sadie. Even though I don’t have siblings, I do have a number of very close friends who are almost part of my family.

As a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) in Newport News. It recently dawned on me that the end of my college career is only a few months away. Being a second semester senior I am fortunate enough to be able to take a couple of elective classes that I would put in the *“fun to take”* category, but will also contribute to my preparation for graduate school and a career. I am majoring in *Fine Arts* with minors in *Graphic Design* and *Leadership Studies*. In fulfilling my final writing intensive requirement I thought that a Digital Humanities course would benefit me as a graphic designer. Better understanding how the language of the internet impacts daily commerce and social interaction is very important, especially in my field of graphic design. 

During my almost four years at CNU, I have volunteered with a number of organizations as a way to give back to those who might not have had the same advantages I’ve enjoyed. During my almost four years I’ve volunteered with Food Fighters and [Fear-2-Freedom](https://www.fear2freedom.org/) as a way to serve the Newport News community. Both experiences allowed me to meet some amazing people and to learn more about myself. Looking back I see that I’ve gotten so much more from these experiences than I ever imagined was possible. And each has helped me come out of my shell and become more confident.

After completing my first semester as a freshman I felt that something was missing in my college experience so I decided to go through sorority recruitment. Participating in it gave me new insights into who I am and how I relate to other women. It turns out that I am more confident than I thought when meeting new people with totally different life experiences. I have enjoyed my time in [Alpha Sigma Alpha](https://www.alphasigmaalpha.org/); **growing** as a woman, **gaining** confidence and **creating** lifelong relationships that will continue to have an impact in my life. 

Last summer I was fortunate to complete a three month internship with the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/programs/about-us/more-about-csis/headquarters), in Washington, DC. There I worked in the iDeas Lab, with other designers on a variety of projects and created detailed graphic illustrations, specialized maps and satellite photographs, as well as learning processes specific to the Center.

With college coming to a close, the next step of my journey is applying to graduate school at George Mason University. Since the graphic design program I’m applying to is conducted in-person and on-line, I am also applying for jobs as a graphic designer. I’m excited to be starting on this new adventure because just like leaving high school and coming to CNU, I’m not sure what lies ahead, but I know I’m ready.
