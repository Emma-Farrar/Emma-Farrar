# Emma Farrar's About Me

Hailing from Alexandria Virginia, I’m an only child and when not at Christopher Newport University, live with my parents, and our seven year old welsh terrier, Sadie. Even though I don’t have siblings, I do have a number of very close friends who are almost part of my family. 

As a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) in Newport News. It recently dawned on me that the end of my college career is only a few months away. Being a second semester senior I am fortunate enough to be able to take a couple of  elective classes that I would put in the “fun to take” category, but will also contribute to my preparation for graduate school and a career. I am majoring in Fine Arts with minors in Graphic Design and Leadership Studies. In fulfilling my final writing intensive requirement I thought that a Digital Humanities course would benefit me as a graphic designer. Better understanding how the language of the internet impacts daily commerce and social interaction is very important, especially in my field of graphic design.
