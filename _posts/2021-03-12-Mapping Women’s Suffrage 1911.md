**About**

Mapping Women’s Suffrage 1911 (MWS) describes the mission to identify and map the locations, together with the lives and materials, of as many Votes for Women campaigners as possible in cities, towns and villages across England in 1911. 

The project combines research and materials from academics, local history enthusiasts, family researchers, archivists and the public to showcase the lives of suffragette women.

**Navigation**

When you first arrive at the website you are met with a slideshow that provides clues to what the website is about. There are a lot of tabs so it’s nice that they are spread out so it’s easier to differentiate them. There are also links to their other social media sites which allows more people to learn about the project.

The website has a nice ratio of images to writings. I found the broken-up text relatively easy to read and understand. I enjoyed the different ways to learn about everything, from podcasts to videos. This makes the whole experience more interactive for the user with fun creative ways to present the information.

**Suffrage Map**

The Suffrage Map shows the locations of suffrage campaigners and their roles in the Votes for Women campaign. The map itself has three different versions to look at; Historic, Simple, and Full. Each woman is denoted by a circular colored dot at the address where they were living in 1911. The map color codes each campaigner icon by which suffrage society they were most active with at that time. 

At first I was confused about what the different letters meant in the list of societies, but then noticed the Suffrage Society Guide PDF on the bottom of the page. The PDF details what each abbreviation stands for and gives a short blurb on them. I thought this was helpful, but I wish instead of abbreviations the map had the full titles.   

I also didn’t like that the instructions for using the map are not on the Suffrage Map tab. To understand how the map works you have to go to Our Mission and Map tabs. It would be more helpful to have all the map information in one spot so that you don’t  have to go back and forth.

Overall I found the map a little confusing. I think the colored dots are helpful, but the key is difficult to understand. If you click the drop-down arrow next to the key categories it gives you a list of the women who are a part of the colored dot group. This can be helpful when looking for a specific woman. Once you find her, you can lock on the name and the map will automatically zoom in on her specific location. I found this feature very helpful because it’s hard to decipher where all of the points are when the map is zoomed out. 

**Digital Humanities**

This website does a good job blending text with visuals, as well as interactive attributes. The map is useful to locate people and provide information about them. By using different headers, a visitor can click through them to learn more about how and why the directors made this project.

I think the subject matter itself is a good humanities project. It deals with society and culture, which is especially important when researching the time of women’s suffrage. Womens’ rights continue to be relevant today, and it is important to document the stories of these women who fought for their rights and set the process moving forward. 

A neat feature of  this website is that the project directors have kept it updated with current information. With all of the interactive features visitors will feel they can engage and even connect with others who might be interested in the topic.

**Phone**

When I looked at the website on my phone it was set up pretty nicely. The spacing of the text made it easy to read and the tab menu was easily accessible on the right side. Viewing the map it has the option “View the Map” (Mobile Version). Even with this different version the Map was a little hard to read. I had this same issue with another website I reviewed. Maybe interactive maps are too complicated to view on a phone screen?

Overall, I think that this project was well put together especially in terms of a user friendly mindset. Combining historic information with interactive features makes the whole experience enjoyable and functional.
